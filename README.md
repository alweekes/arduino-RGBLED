# arduino-RGBLED
Arduino implementation of a smooth sinusoidal RGB LED fade, with debounced interrupt-driven switch input to toggle RGB mode
or full white (all LED's on).

Original idea for sinusoidal fade from https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-Proper-Rainbow-and-Random-Colors-With-/

Also included is the Arduino UNO wiring information and the layout of a MOSFET driver stripboard to drive the LED's. Powering the Arduino from 12V enables it to provide power to the 12V LED strip.
